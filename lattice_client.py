def get_corner_atoms(element, lparam):
    """
    Returns a list of corner Atoms, all having the specified `element` name
    and with each having an (x, y, z) position at one of the corners for a
    cube of `lparam` length.

    The origin corner is set to (0, 0, 0) and the diagonally-opposite corner at
    (length, length, length). For example, if length is 2, the Atom positioned
    at the origin corner would still have coordinates (0, 0, 0), but the
    diagonally-opposite Atom would have coordinates (2, 2, 2).

    Arguments:
        - element (str): name to give to each corner Atom
        - lparam (int): length of cube to scale corners by

    Returns:
        - (list[Atom]): list of 8 corner Atoms having positions distributed in
          a cube of length `lparam`.
