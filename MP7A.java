/**
 * CS 1 22fa MP 7 Part A Starter Code
 * Intro to Java
 * Student name: Julian Navarro Rodriguez
 * 
 * Reminder: Part A is strictly no-collaboration. If you run into questions,
 * ask on Discord/OH!
 * 
 * This is an executable "client" Java program (as opposed to the 
 * DNA class defined in DNA.java). Note that this client
 * program has a main method, which is called when the program
 * is ran from the terminal (or in an IDE), similar to the
 * code ran in an if __name__ == '__main__' branch in a .py program.
 * 
 * If running a .java program in the terminal (assuming you have 
 * java installed), you can run this as follows:
 * 
 * $ javac MP7A.java
 * $ java MP7A
 * 
 * Analogous to:
 * $ python3 mp7a.py
 * 
 * The first line compiles the Java program (javac stands for compile Java).
 * The second line runs the compiled Java program, assuming no
 * compiler errors were thrown when compiling (very common to get these
 * when you have errors in your first Java programs). 
 * 
 * Alternatively, you can use the Play -> Run Java button in VSCode,
 * though the first approach can be helpful to get a feel for 
 * the required "compile, then run" process in Java.
 * You can find a Java setup guide on the course website to get you started 
 * as well.

    /**
     * Part A.2. String Expressions
     * Write your answers for Part A.2. here.
     * Two examples of what we expect for your answers are provided below,
     * one with a valid assignment and the other with an error.
     * -------------------------------------------------- 
     * Example format of expected answers:
     * 0. String result = "foo";
     * a. "foo" 
     * b. No error
     * c. Aside from the type and ;, Python evaluates "foo" the same as Java.
     * 
     * 0. String result = foo;
     * a. Error 
     * b. MP7A.java:35: error: cannot find symbol
          String result = foo;
                        ^
          symbol:   variable foo
          location: class MP7A
     * c. Python and Java have similar errors in this case missing quotes
     * around characters that are expected to be treated as String/str values.
     * For example: (you don't have to go this in depth, but you are encouraged to
     *               to indicate you actually understand the error/difference between Java and Python)
     * >>> result = foo
     * gives an error for an undefined variable/symbol 
       Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
       NameError: name 'foo' is not defined
     * however, this error occurs when the Java program is compiled, 
     * whereas Python (which we don't compile) raises the NameError only
     * when the statement is (unsuccessfully) executed in a ran .py program or interpreter. 
     * -------------------------------------------------- 
     * 1. String result = "foo" + 'bar';
     * a. Error
     * b. MP7A.java:53: error: unclosed character literal
          String result = "foo" + 'bar';
     * c. Python considers single quotes ('') and double quotes ("") the same. Java considers
     *    single quotes for characters and double quotes for strings.
     * -------------------------------------------------- 
     * 2. String result = "foo" + "bar";
     * a. "foobar"
     * b. No error 
     * c. The addition of string is the same in Java and in Python.
     * -------------------------------------------------- 
     * 3. String result = "foo"
     *    String b = "bar"
     *    String result += b;
     * a. Error
     * b. MP7A.java:53: error: ';' expected
                String result = "foo"
                             ^
          MP7A.java:54: error: ';' expected
                String b = "bar"
                        ^
          MP7A.java:55: error: ';' expected
                String result += b;
     * c. At the end of every line when you are defining a variable in Java you need a semicolon.
     *    Python does not need a semicolon to define variables.
     * -------------------------------------------------- 
     * 4. String month = "October";
          int days = 31;
          String result = days + " days hath " + month;
          System.out.println(result); 
     * a. 31 days hath October
     * b. No error
     * c. You can concatenate different types in Java but you cannot do this in Python. 
     *    Here we see that we are concatenating a integer with string in Java and that will not
     *    work in Python.

    /**
     * Part A.3. String Generation
     * Warm-up:
     * Write your answers for Part A.3.a. and B.3.b. here, 
     * indicating the evaluated result (or an error/what type 
     * if an error is thrown) **as well as whether the behavior
     * was different than what you expected**.
     * -------------------------------------------------- 
     * a. '-' * 70 evaluates 3150. I totally did not expect it.
     *    I expected the character '-' to be repeated 70 times.
     * b. "-" * 70 evaluates an error that says " bad operand types for binary operator '*'
                                        System.out.println("-" * 70);

                            second type: int"
     * I did expect this because "-" is a character and is represented as an string. 
     * -------------------------------------------------- 
     * c. Next, you'll write your first Java function to implement
     * the string multiplication behavior we get with * in Python.
     * We are providing the function stub and documentation to get
     * you started, which you are encouraged to use as reference for
     * the methods you write in Parts B/C (though note that Parts B-C.2.
     * will be written in a stateful class without an executable main method,
     * which is why you'll use "this." in those class methods, but not here).
     * 
     * The equivalent of a Python docstring in Java is called a javadoc 
     * comment. These use multiline comments in the format below (_above_
     * the function, not within). Javadoc comments clearly indicate parameters 
     * and any return value with @params and @return; because each method
     * includes types in its signature, these annotations do not need to
     * re-specify the types, which is different than Python docstrings.
     * 
     * The provided function/Javadoc template is commented out with //
     * so a compiler error isn't thrown due to placeholders:
